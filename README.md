*"developer? i barely knew 'er!"*

in order of experience, i work with the following "languages":
- HTML (very comfortable)
- CSS (can do what i need)
- VB.Net (years of making joke programs)
- Python (getting okay at)
- Rust (just started learning)
- JavaScript (used a tiny bit years ago)
- C# (used an even tinier bit years ago)

mainly i'm a content creator & streamer, but i'll do the odd thing or two on here sometimes..!
